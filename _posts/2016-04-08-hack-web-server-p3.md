This example extends deeper into the code base of a website.  You will actually need to
use the web browser development tools to complete the work this time.  This site is a
bit harder than last week but more like the first example we did.


### Object

The company is getting pretty frustrated at their failures now.  They have extended
the website security with  the help of an html developer.  That said, the goal is
the same as last week.

You have been tasked with gaining access to a restricted page of a company
website.  Breaking or making the system unresponsive is **not** the intent.
You can use whatever resources you have available to do the task as long as
the server remains on-line and responsive.

Upon success you will receive two golden penguin!
