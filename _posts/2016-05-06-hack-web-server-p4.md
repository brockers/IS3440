More advanced website hacking technique.  You will need to use several things that you
learned previously to be successful.


### Object

The company really thinks it has it figured out this time.  They have extended
the website security with  the help of an software developer.  The goal is
the same as previous weeks.

You have been tasked with gaining access to a restricted page of a company
website.  Breaking or making the system unresponsive is **not** the intent.
You can use whatever resources you have available to do the task as long as
the server remains on-line and responsive.

Upon success you will receive three golden penguin and something else!
