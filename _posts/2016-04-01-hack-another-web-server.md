Building on what you did last week, and teaching you to look at all aspects of
a given system are the goals for this hack.  Unlike last week I have actually
seen some __REALLY BAD__ websites do this.

### Object

The company wanting you to check their website was not happy with how easily
it was done last time.  They have buckled down and made a newer, even
__MORE__ secure website this time.  The goals is the same as last week.

You have been tasked with gaining access to a restricted page of a company
website.  Breaking or making the system unresponsive is **not** the intent.
You can use whatever resources you have available to do the task as long as
the server remains on-line and responsive.

Upon success you will receive two golden penguin!
