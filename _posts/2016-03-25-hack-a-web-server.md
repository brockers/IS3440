This is a simple exercise in hacking a website login.  This is not a particularly
useful exercise or production web servers as you will quickly find, but it
does work as a good beginner tutorial on finding and identifying system weaknesses
for anyone who hasn't done it before.

### Object

You have been tasked with gaining access to the restricted section of a company
website.  Breaking or making the system unresponsive is **not** the intent.
You can use whatever resources you have available to do the task as long as
the server remains on-line and responsive.

Upon success you will receive a golden penguin.
